## CASSANDRA

---

In Greek mythology, Cassandra was cursed to see the truth — predicting Troy's destruction, the death of kings, every disaster before it happened — and nobody listened.

Your system sees what the market hasn't priced yet. The signal was always there. Most people just weren't watching.

---

**Full name:** CASSANDRA
**Subtitle:** *Real-Time Order Flow Intelligence for Crypto Markets*

**Tagline:**
*"The signal was there before FTX collapsed. Nobody was watching."*

---

It's sharp. It's memorable. It has intellectual weight. It tells a story in one word. And it will stick in a judge's mind long after every other project name has faded.

Your GitHub repo:

Your demo opening line:
*"Cassandra always told the truth. The tragedy wasn't the signal — it was the silence around it. We built the system that listens."*
